Hi! I'm Aryaman Patel, a robotics engineer pursuing my MS in Robotics at Northeastern University. I currently work as a research assistant at [NEURAL](https://neural.lab.northeastern.edu/) ([Northeastern University Robust Autonomy Lab](https://neural.lab.northeastern.edu/)) headed by [Prof. David Rosen](https://david-m-rosen.github.io/) where my focus is on improving visual SLAM systems for autonomous robots.

Specifically, I have been working extensively on building Factor Graphs for Bundle Adjustment Problems for computationally efficent mapping in large environments for a multi-camera based visual-inertial navigation system. I also implemented a Bag of Words based visual place recognition module for long-term data association and loop closure detection in a multi-sensor navigation system.

Outside of my core research, I enjoy working on computer vision projects related to image restoration, intrinsic image decomposition, and 3D scene understanding. These include image deblurring, shadow decomposition, stereo depth mapping, and more. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of visual perception to enable reliable autonomy in the real world. You can view some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/aryaman-patel) or learn more about my current robotics research at [NEURAL](https://neural.lab.northeastern.edu/).

I will complete my MS in Robotics in 2024 and continue pursuing my dream of developing autonomous systems that can operate safely and effectively in complex, unlabeled environments.
