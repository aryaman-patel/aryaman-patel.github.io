Hi! I have nurtured a deep interest in Robotics throughout my undergraduate studies. More specifically, I am keen to work in the upcoming field of autonomous cars, More specifically in the fields of Visual based SLAM techniqies and development of higher resoultion maps of the robot environment for the improvement of the performance of autonomous vehicles. Courses I have taken include Mobile Robotics, Robot Sensing and Navigation, Computer Vision, Robot Science and System. The cornerstones of my work has always been based on solid mathematical foundations along with efficient and robust coding methodologies.  

A short overview of my previous work...
======
My undergraduate studies helped me develop excellent fundamentals in applied mathematics, especially in numerical methods for ordinary differential equations and optimization techniques. I applied these skills in my research for solving non-linear ordinary differential equations that represented the continuity, momentum, andenergy equations of a nanofluid. I modeled two nanonfluids under conditions like electro-osmosis, magneto-hydrodynamics and porous medium. Furthermore, I discussed the change in velocity, concentration, and the temperature of the nanofluid with increasing specific parameters. Through this research, I developed my interest in analytical study and gained skills in using MATLAB to solve non-linear equations.
