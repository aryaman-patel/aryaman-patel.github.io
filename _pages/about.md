Hi! I'm Aryaman Patel, a robotics engineer pursuing my MS in Robotics at Northeastern University. I currently work as a research assistant at NEURAL ([Northeastern University Robust Autonomy Lab](https://neural.lab.northeastern.edu/)) headed by [Prof. David Rosen](https://david-m-rosen.github.io/) where my focus is on improving visual SLAM systems for autonomous robots.

Specifically, I have been working extensively on building Factor Graphs for Bundle Adjustment Problems for computationally efficent mapping in large environments for a multi-camera based visual-inertial navigation system. I also implemented a Bag of Words based visual place recognition module for long-term data association and loop closure detection in a multi-sensor navigation system.

Outside of my core research, I enjoy working on computer vision projects related to image restoration, intrinsic image decomposition, and 3D scene understanding. These include image deblurring, shadow decomposition, stereo depth mapping, and more. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of visual perception to enable reliable autonomy in the real world. You can view some of my work on GitHub or learn more about my current robotics research at NEURAL.

I will complete my MS in Robotics in 2024 and continue pursuing my dream of developing autonomous systems that can operate safely and effectively in complex, unlabeled environments.

### [Scan matching using ICP in C++](https://github.com/aryaman-patel/MobileRobotics5550#scan-matching-using-iterative-closest-point)
This is a personal project I wished to try. In this I have implement the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, and use it to estimate the rigid transformation that optimally aligns two 3D pointclouds. The given two pointclouds $X,Y \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$ have an initial guess $(t_0,R_0) \in SE(d)$ for the optimal rigid registration $y = R_x + t$ aligning $X$ to $Y$. 

This is the resultant point cloud -

In this implementation I have used a library I was fascinated by while going through ORB-SLAM's source code, this library is called [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) which is a C++ template for linear algebra!  -->
