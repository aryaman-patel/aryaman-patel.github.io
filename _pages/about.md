Hi! I am a MS Robotics Student from the ECE department at Northeastern University. My net of interests is cast in wide areas mainly around topics of robot perception, motion planning, visual based SLAM techniques and, certifiably correct algorithms. The cornerstones of my work have always been based on solid mathematical foundations and, efficient and robust coding methodologies.

I am accustomed to coding languages like C++ and in the use of ROS software. Currently, I am actively learning topics like Multiple View Geometry, Visual inertial fusion, Bundle adjustment and Vision algorithms for mobile robotics.
