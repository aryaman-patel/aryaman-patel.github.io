Hi! I have nurtured a deep interest in Robotics throughout my undergraduate studies. More specifically, I am keen to work in the upcoming field of autonomous cars, More specifically in the fields of Visual based SLAM techniqies and development of higher resoultion maps of the robot environment for the improvement of the performance of autonomous vehicles. Courses I have taken include Mobile Robotics, Robot Sensing and Navigation, Computer Vision, Robot Science and System. The cornerstones of my work has always been based on solid mathematical foundations along with efficient and robust coding methodologies.  

A short overview of my previous work...
