    title: "Mathematical modeling of nanofluids"
---
<p align="justify"> 
Hi! I am a MS Robotics Student from the ECE department at Northeastern University. My net of interests is cast in wide areas mainly around topics of robot perception, motion planning, visual based SLAM techniques and, certifiably correct algorithms. The cornerstones of my work have always been based on solid mathematical foundations and, efficient and robust coding methodologies.

I am accustomed to coding languages like C++ and in the use of ROS software. Currently, I am actively learning topics like Multiple View Geometry, Visual inertial fusion, Bundle adjustment and Vision algorithms for mobile robotics.

### Academic Research Background:
**Mathematical Modelling of Nanofluids**
<p align="justify">
My undergraduate studies helped me develop excellent fundamentals in applied mathematics,especially in numerical methods for ordinary differential equations and optimization techniques. I applied these skills in my research for solving non-linear ordinary differential equations that represented the continuity, momentum, and energy equations of a nanofluid. I modeled two nanonfluids under conditions like electro-osmosis, magneto-hydrodynamics and
porous medium. I developed my interest in analytical study and gained skills in using MATLAB to solve non- linear equations.

**Developing Evolutionary Algorithms to solve Advance Engineering Problems**
<p align="justify">
Optimization algorithms introduce efficient methods to find optimal parameters for complex equations helpful in studying the dynamics of a robot. I researched developing a new constraint handling method that challenges different evolutionary algorithms used to maximize or minimize objective functions subject to constraints. Using the socio-inspired algorithm of Cohort Intelligence and a modified probability distribution approach, and vectorized coding
adapted from Machine Learning algorithms, I developed an efficient algorithm. I tested this algorithm and compared with different Evolutionary Algorithms for solving advanced manufacturing problems that showed considerable improvement in run-time and for finding the optimal values for the parameters under consideration. The work added to my research experience and improved my skills in MATLAB programming.
