## Mathematical Modelling of Nanofluids.
Mathematically modeled the continuity, momentum, and energy equations of two non-Newtonian nanofluids. The equations were numerically solved for changes in velocity, concentration, and temperature with the changes in physical parameters, and the results plotted.

## Developing Evolutionary Algorithms to solve Advance Engineering Problems.
Developed a novel approach to solve constrained optimization problems. The new algorithm is incorporated with a socio-inspired algorithm called Cohort Intelligence with a modified probability distribution approach created by Tanh and Modular function. The efficiency of the code was tested on Kyoto Test problems, and it showed up to 98% improvement compared to other EAs.
