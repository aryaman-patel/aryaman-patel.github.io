Mathematical Modelling of Nanofluids.
======
Mathematically modeled the continuity, momentum, and energy equations of two non-Newtonian nanofluids. The equations were numerically solved for changes in velocity, concentration, and temperature with the changes in physical parameters, and the results plotted.

Developing Evolutionary Algorithms to solve Advance Engineering Problems.
======
Developed a novel approach to solve constrained optimization problems. The new algorithm is incorporated with a socio-inspired algorithm called Cohort Intelligence with a modified probability distribution approach created by Tanh and Modular function. The efficiency of the code was tested on Kyoto Test problems, and it showed up to 98% improvement compared to other EAs.
